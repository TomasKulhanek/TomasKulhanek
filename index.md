I'm software developer with a special focus on scientific virtual research environment utilizing grid and cloud computing leveraging the computational, configuration, installation task in order to enable high quality research supported by current technology and contemporary methods.

## Current project
- [H2020 West-Life](https://www.west-life.eu) - Virtual Research Environment for Structural Biology
- [Virtual Folder](https://github.com/h2020-westlife-eu/west-life-wp6) - virtual folder view of scattered data, aggregates multiple data storage resource and provides unified way to access them, test VM template is available from source codes
- [Repository](https://github.com/h2020-westlife-eu/wp6-repository) - exemplar implementation of repository of data for small and middle facilities in order to follow data management during life cycle of data in structural biology research.
- Talk at CERN about the project from [http://cds.cern.ch/record/2302615](http://cds.cern.ch/record/2302615)

## Books
- [Medical Physiology in Modelica](http://book.physiovalues.tk) - 10% complete, aim to deliver interactive book with models in modelica following common methods in modeling human physiology.

## Past projects
- [Physiovalues](http://www.physiovalues.tk) - web based system to perform simulation and parameter identification in multiple nodes distributed in local cluster or cloud computing environment
- [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org) - Modelica library to enable and facilitate modeling of human physiology using mechanistic approach introduced in original [HumMod](http://www.hummod.org) and [Physiomodel](http://www.physiomodel.org) 
- [Psychoacoustic Tests](http://physiome.lf1.cuni.cz/psychoacoustictest/) - web application to edit and perform assesment of perception on sounds, voice and music

Short interview in EGI user forum about relation of scientific domain (physiology) and technology (grid & cloud computing).
